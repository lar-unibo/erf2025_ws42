													<i><strong>Title:</strong></i> Plan Replanning and Repair at PlanSys2<br>
													<i><strong>Abstract:</strong></i> PlanSys2 is the reference planning framework in ROS 2. It combines classical planning with Behavior Trees to execute plans on real robots.  
													However, replanning in such frameworks is typically limited to canceling the current plan and generating a new one from scratch. In this talk, we will explore alternative approaches for adapting to changes in conditions or goals, focusing on repairing the current plan to align with the new situation.  
													We will discuss how various strategies, including the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in this task, can enhance the efficiency of plan execution.

													<i><strong>Title:</strong></i> The Purpose Framework: A Path to Useful Autonomous Robots<br>
													<i><strong>Abstract:</strong></i> This talk will introduce the main issues that are being addressed in the PILLAR-Robots project related to Lifelong Open-ended Learning Autonomy (LOLA).
													PILLAR-Robots seeks to create the basis for developing a new generation of robots endowed with a higher level of autonomy, able to determine their own goals and strategies creatively, building on the experience acquired during their lifetime to fulfill the desires of their designers/users in real-life application use cases. <br> 
													The concept of Purpose, drawn from cognitive sciences, is operationalized to increase the autonomy and domain independence of robots during autonomous learning, leading them to acquire knowledge and skills that are actually relevant for operating in target real applications.  <br>
													In particular, the talk will describe the purpose framework, which has been developed as an integrated motivational structure that supports algorithms for:  
													- The acquisition of purpose by the robot;
													- Ways to bias the perceptual, motivational, and decision systems of the robots' cognitive architectures toward purposes;
													- Strategies for learning representations, skills, and models that allow the execution of purpose-related deliberative and reactive decisions.
													These ideas are being applied in three different application fields characterized by different types and levels of variability: Agri-food, Edutainment, and unstructured Industrial/retail.

													<i><strong>Title:</strong></i> Leveraging uncertainty and interactive guidance for robot skill acquisition<br>
													<i><strong>Abstract:</strong></i> When acquiring new manipulation skills, robots must navigate uncertainty while leveraging interactive guidance to adapt to dynamic, real-world environments. By employing uncertainty-aware motion primitives to model and refine skills and constrained reinforcement learning to explore within safe and practical limits, robots can unify human demonstrations, corrective feedback, and task constraints. In this talk, I will present recent results on uncertainty-aware, human-centered frameworks that facilitate adaptive and reliable robot learning in manipulation tasks.

													<i><strong>Title:</strong></i> From the Lab to the Kitchen:  Data-efficient Learning and Sim2Real in the EU-Project euRobin<br>
													<i><strong>Abstract:</strong></i> This presentation outlines the EU-Project euRobin's approach to advancing data-efficient learning and simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) transfer for robotics. Focusing on robotic manipulation tasks, it explores how perception systems can classify, detect, and track objects, estimate their poses, and identify functional grasps. The project emphasizes overcoming key challenges like inverse problems, the open-world assumption, and adapting from controlled lab environments to complex real-world settings such as kitchens. Through simulated training, virtual environments, and real-world transfer, euRobin aims to develop cognition-enabled, transferable embodied AI for robust robotic applications.

													<i><strong>Title:</strong></i> How we tell the robot what to do? Deliberation in CONVINCE<br>
													<i><strong>Abstract:</strong></i> In this workshop talk, we explore the question: How do we tell a robot what to do? focusing on deliberation within the CONVINCE project. Deliberation, also known as task-planning or mission-planning, is essential for enabling robots to operate autonomously and adaptively in dynamic environments.<br>  
													We will present the tools and approaches developed in CONVINCE, including formal methods, machine learning, and anomaly detection, and discuss how these support robust decision-making. Drawing from insights gained through the Deliberation Working Group and a ROSCon workshop, we will address key open questions:  
													- What do users need to enable effective robot autonomy?  
													- How does deliberation differ from traditional industrial robot programming?  
													- How can we balance low-code solutions with flexible configuration?  
													- How do we ensure explainability and interpretability, aligning with Industry 5.0 principles?  
													<br>
													This talk aims to engage the audience in a discussion on the unique challenges of modern deliberation, fostering ideas for bridging the gap between robot programming and autonomous behavior.
